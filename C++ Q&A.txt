C++ Internal Training Assessment:
Basics_Classwork Module:
1) Write a program to print the ASCII value of a character

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    char a;
    int b;
    cin>>a;
    b=a;
    cout<<b;
    return 0;
}

2) Write a program to multiply two integers

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a,b;
    cin>>a>>b;
    cout<<a*b;
    return 0;

}

3) Write a program that accepts two integers as input and prints their sum.
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{ 
    int a,b;
    cin>>a>>b;
    cout<<a+b;
    return 0;
}

4) Customized Welcome Message
Nikhil, the founder of “Pine Tree” company wished to design an Event Management System that would let its Customers plan and host events seamlessly via an online platform.
As a part of this requirement, Nikhil wanted to write a piece of code for his company’s Examly Event Management System that will display customized welcome messages by taking Customers’ name as input. Help Nikhil on the task.

#include <iostream> 
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    char name[50];
    cin>>name;
    cout<<"Hello "<<name<<"! Welcome to Examly Event Management System";
    return 0;
}

5) Write a program that accepts a user name and password as input and prints the same.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    char user[68],password[78];
    cin>>user>>password;
    cout<<user<<"\t"<<password;
}

Operators_Classwork Module:
1) Average Calculation
A teacher wants to compute the average of 5 students in her class. Write a program to help her to find the average. The average is the sum of all the numbers, then divided by the total numbers.

#include<iostream>
#include<iomanip>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    float a,b,c,d,e;
    cin>>a>>b>>c>>d>>e;
    cout<<fixed<<setprecision(2)<<(a+b+c+d+e)/5;
}

2) Ternary Operator﻿
The conditional operator is also known as the ternary operator [exp? true: false] can be used to make an either-or choice. Write a program to get a number from the user and find out whether it is odd or even.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a;
    cin>>a;
    cout<<((a%2==0)?"Even":"Odd");
}

3) Evaluation of expression:
Sasikumar is a mathematics teacher and he is preparing a question paper of his own, So he needs to calculate the answers to the questions he prepared without any errors. As he is busy with his work he has no time to make it.
Write the program and trace the output for the following expressions:
a) x = a + b * 5 / 4 + c % 3 * 5, where a, b and c are variables ( inputs ).
b) y = u >v ? u : v ; where u and v are variables ( inputs ).
c) z = ++i&& ++j && ++k; where i, j, and k are variables ( inputs ).

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a,b,c,u,v,i,j,k,x,y,z;
    cin>>a>>b>>c>>u>>v>>i>>j>>k;
    x=a+b*5/4+c%3*5;
    y=(u>v)?u:v;
    z=++i&&++j&&++k;
    cout<<"x = "<<x<<"\ny = "<<y<<"\nz = "<<z;
    
}

4) MILEAGE REMUNERATION CALCULATOR
Write a program that calculates mileage remuneration for a salesperson at a rate of Rs.25 per mile. Your program should interact with the user in this manner:
Sample Output 1: (Explanation)
Enter beginning odometer reading: 13505.2
Enter ending odometer reading: 13810.6
You traveled 305.4 miles. At Rs.25 per mile, your remuneration is Rs.7635
Note: Display the output to two decimal places and round the remuneration value.

#include <iostream>
#include<cmath>
#include<iomanip>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    float beg,end,km,rem;
    cin>>beg>>end;
    km=end-beg;
    rem=km*25;
    cout<<fixed<<setprecision(2)<<km<<" "<<round(rem);
}

5) Seetha, a newly joined maths teacher explained percentage concept in her class. She asked the student to calculate their attendance percentage based on the number of working days and the number of days the student is present. She asked the student to calculate the attendance percentage with decimal places truncated. (Ex. 75.89% as 75%)
Help students to calculate the attendance percentage.
Note : Display the output with % symbol

#include <iostream>
#include<cmath>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    float wd,dp,pct;
    cin>>wd>>dp;
    pct=(dp/wd)*100;
    cout<<trunc(pct)<<"%";
}
